Why is this needed?
Your Flask backend controls access to the /api/idf/curves endpoint and similar routes delivering your important data.

By default, Flask will serve those endpoints to anyone who makes a request, unless you add logic to restrict access.

If you want to allow free/public access only during a certain date window, and otherwise require login, Flask must check each request to see:

Is the current time within the free-access period?

(If not) Is the request authenticated?

If neither, deny with a 401 error.

This logic needs to run every time those protected endpoints are hit, which is exactly what middleware or a route decorator does in Flask.
(In Express/Node you add logic with app.use(middleware, ...); in Flask, you use a decorator like @require_idf_access.)

What happens without middleware/decorator?
Anyone can always query your important IDF API.

There is no way to enforce the free-trial window, or require login after it.

You'd have to add messy, duplicate logic to every function that should be protected.

So: Middleware/decorator is the correct, maintainable solution for:
Checking free-access time window.

Allowing/denying access based on authentication and time.

Centralizing the security logic so it's not repeated all over your code.

Summary:
If your main IDF features are delivered by Flask, then yes:
You need a Flask middleware or route decorator, applied to your IDF routes, to automate free-trial access logic and keep your API secure, as you intended.

Would you like a ready-to-use decorator you can add to your Flask routes?Yes, you do need middleware (or, in Flask, a decorator that acts like middleware) in your Flask app because:

Your Flask backend is what actually responds to requests for IDF curves.

Only Flask can "decide" whether to allow or deny access before the endpoint logic is run.

Flask, by default, does not restrict access—any client can call any endpoint unless you add logic to check for a free-access window or authentication.

Middleware (in Flask: a decorator or a before_request function) is the proper way to apply logic to every request (or to a route/group of routes) to automatically:

Check "is this request during free access?"

If not, check if the user is logged in (auth token/session).

Allow or return 401/403 error as appropriate.

Without Flask-side middleware or decorator, anyone can access your IDF endpoint at any time.

This is exactly what you want to automate so you don't have to write this logic in every route—the decorator allows you to keep things secure, clean, and maintainable.

If you implement this with a Flask decorator (see previous message for sample), you achieve the goal:

Free/public trial for a window,

Then restricted access after.
